# ðŸ“¦ MicroInventorySystem-Inventory
## Microservice 2: Inventory Service - Overview

This is the Inventory Service, a core component in a microservices-based inventory system responsible for managing 
product stock levels. It handles inventory creation, updates, and retrieval of stock quantities. The service exposes 
RESTful endpoints that allow other microservicesâ€”such as the Product Serviceâ€”to fetch real-time inventory data and 
ensure availability before processing operations like order placement or stock checks.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Store inventory documents (productId + quantity) in MongoDB 
- Retrieve stock quantity by productId 
- RESTful endpoints using Spring Boot 
- Clean architecture with DTOs and service layer 
- Uses MongoDB as a NoSQL backend for scalability and flexibility
